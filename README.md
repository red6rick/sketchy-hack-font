# sketchy-hack-font
A vertically reversed font to mitigate Sketchup 2017 compatability issues with MacOS

This is a "hacked" modification of the beautiful Hack font
at https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack .

It is released under the same license as the original, copied here for
convenience.

The reason that this font exists is that something broke on the
graphic interface between MacOS Monterey and Sketchup 2017. On some systems, notably
native Mac systems without internal graphcs (and Hackintoshes :-), the
text shown on screen for dimensions was reversed vertically.

Lots of web searches indicated lots of people having the same problem, and
no solutions. Apple isn't going to fix a problem for a single "outdated"
application, and Trimble isn't going to fix a 5 year old version of its
premier application when it wants all users to upgrade to newer versions.

So, enter Sketchy-Hack. I took the regular (no I didn't worry about bold
or italics) version of the Hack font, put it into Font Foundary, stripped
all the extra unicode from it, and vertically flipped all the remaining
characters.

The result: using this font, perfect dimensions on my computer.

The technique should apply to virtually any font anyone wanted to
modify by this technique.

Have fun, and keep sketching!
